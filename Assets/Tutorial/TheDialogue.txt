Welcome to the samurai school, I am your master, Master Who.
In this tutorial, you will be learning how to fight like a samurai.
First, you must know that you have 3 ways to fight.
They are Slash, Counter, and Sneak Attack.
Slash does 2 damage, it cancels enemy's sneak attack, but could be countered using Counter.
Counter can nullify enemy's Slash, and fight back to deal 1 damage, but it could not nullify Sneak Attack.
Sneak Attack is a quick attack that breakthrough Counters and does 1 damage. But it does not work on ememy's Slash.
Here is the restriction map if you need it.
There are 3 rounds in total. Every round has 3 slot that represents the order of using the attacks, from left to right.
You have to determine which attack to use in every slot.
Of course, you can also make it blank to bait attacks.
You can read you and your ememy's attacks here. The attacks that are availible in this round are lighten up.
After place the attacks, you can click next to watch the battle.
Another important thing to mention, you must not hold more than 2 cards before you end your turn.
If you have too many attacks, you can fold your card by placing them on the fold area.
When you deal more damage than your enemy, you dominates in that round.
You must dominate 2 rounds to win the fight. 
That's basically today's lesson. Good luck, my student.
